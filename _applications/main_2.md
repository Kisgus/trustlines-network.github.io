More than 4000 complementary currency systems exist operated by communities who aim for cooperation, stimulating circular economy and reducing the need for national currencies. The Trustlines Network can solve the main problems collaborative currency communities are currently facing, such as counterfeiting, convertibility of the currency, governance of its issuance and the lack of tooling. The Trustlines Network will make it easy to setup and maintain such systems.
