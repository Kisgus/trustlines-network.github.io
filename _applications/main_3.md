The one billion unbanked people worldwide owning a smartphone with internet access will directly benefit, as the Trustlines Network gives them permissionless access to bank like services. Same goes for the even larger group of underbanked people, who can leverage their social relationships to get credit lines and money beyond what they could get from commercial banks. Contrary to informal finance, the Trustlines Network does automatic and tamper-proof accounting which will boost the willingness to grant credit.
